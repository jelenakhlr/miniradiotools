# miniradiotools
 
Welcome to the miniradiotools package! It is a minimalistic python package for the basic needs in radio analysis.

Since miniradiotools is meant to be used with CORSIKA (https://web.iap.kit.edu/corsika/usersguide/usersguide.pdf) and its radio extension CoREAS (https://web.ikp.kit.edu/huege/downloads/coreas-manual.pdf), it uses CORSIKA conventions.

It's inspired by the radiotools package: https://github.com/nu-radio/radiotools/
